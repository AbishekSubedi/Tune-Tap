# TuneTap

TuneTap is an interactive tap-based project that explores real-time user input handling and responsive system behavior. The project focuses on clean software design, modular structure, and event-driven logic, making it suitable for academic demonstrations, experimentation, and future expansion into intelligent or adaptive systems.

## Project Overview

TuneTap captures user interaction events (such as taps or triggers), processes them in real time, and generates immediate responses. The project was developed to demonstrate principles of human–computer interaction, responsiveness, and modular programming, with an emphasis on clarity and extensibility rather than complexity.

### Application Interface
![TuneTap Interface](images/interface.png)

## How It Works

1. The system listens for user input events (taps or triggers).
2. Each input is passed to the processing logic.
3. The system interprets the input using predefined rules.
4. An output or response is generated in real time.

This modular flow makes it easy to add new interaction types, additional rules, or smarter behavior later.
